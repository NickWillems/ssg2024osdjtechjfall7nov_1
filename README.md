## The Goal
Write a program that finds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence of numbers in an array.

------------------

## Rules

Your task is to determine the longest subsequence of consecutive numbers in the input array that are in strictly increasing order. This sequence MUST be continuous in the array.

------------------

## Game Input

### Input
- **Line 1**: A series of integers separated by spaces.

### Output
- Print the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in the array.

------------------

### Example
**Input**
`10 22 9 33 21 50 41 60 80`
**Output**
3

**Explanation**: The longest increasing subsequence is `41, 60, 80`, with a length of 3.
